In this project, we successfully built an Image Classification Model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in TensorFlow. The model was trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

The key steps included:

Data Preprocessing: Normalized pixel values and reshaped images to fit the CNN input format.

Model Architecture: Used convolutional, pooling, flattening, and dense layers to extract and classify features.

Training: The model was trained for several epochs with good accuracy and validation performance.

Evaluation: The final accuracy on the test set showed that the model can classify handwritten digits effectively.
description

In this task, we developed an Image Classification model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically identify and classify images. CNNs are a class of deep learning models that are specifically designed for analyzing visual data.

We used the MNIST dataset, which contains thousands of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9). The model takes an input image, extracts features using convolutional layers, reduces dimensionality using pooling layers, and finally predicts the digit using fully connected layers.

This model learns from the pixel patterns and achieves high accuracy in recognizing digits. CNNs are widely used in real-world applications such as facial recognition, object detection, and medical imaging.
